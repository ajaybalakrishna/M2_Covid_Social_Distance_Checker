# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT : 
Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is a type of resistor that is affected by light. They provide you the ability to detect light. The resistance of LDR varies according on the quantity of light falling on it. When light falls on an LDR, its resistance drops, allowing current (represented by the red line) to travel through it, as seen in the diagram below.
# INTRODUCTION :
A light-dependent resistor, or LDR, is an electrical component that responds to light. When light rays strike it, the resistance changes very instantly. An LDR's resistance levels can vary by several orders of magnitude. When the light level rises, the resistance value decreases.
In the dark, the resistance of LDR is several megaohms, whereas in strong light, it is only a few hundred ohms. As a result of the resistance change, these resistors are widely used in a variety of applications. The wavelength of the incident light also affects the LDR sensitivity.
The light-sensitive features of LDRs can be achieved by developing them with semiconductor materials. Despite the fact that CdS (cadmium sulphide) is the most well-known substance utilised in this resistor.

# PRINCIPLE:
Photo conductivity is used to operate this resistor. When light strikes the device's surface, the material conductivity decreases, and electrons in the valence band of the device are stimulated to the conduction band.

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES :
* ATMega328
* LDR Sensor
* Resistor
* LED's
* Voltage Source
* Connecting wires
* Buzzer

# Applications of LDR :
* These devices are employed in situations where it is important to detect the presence and absence of light. 
* LDRs are utilised as light sensors and are commonly found in alarm clocks, street lights, light intensity metres, and burglar alarm circuits.
* Used as part of a SCADA system to perform functions such as counting the number of packages on a moving conveyor belt.
 
# Advantages and Disadvantages :
# Advantages :
* It's simple to combine with lighting systems like automatic lighting.
* It is used to reduce energy consumption or manage energy by controlling the brightness level of mobile phones and turning on and off street lights based on the amount of ambient light.
* Light sensors based on LDR (i.e. photoresistor) technology come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
* The operation of light sensors necessitates a low voltage and power supply.
* Photoresistors are less expensive, bi-directional, and have a medium response time.
* Photodiodes have a fast response time, are less expensive, and produce digital output.
* In comparison to photoresistors, phototransistors are extremely quick and deliver rapid output.
* In comparison to photodiodes, phototransistors generate a lot of current.

# Disadvantages :
* LDRs are inherently incorrect and have a long response time (about 10s or 100s of milliseconds).
* Photoresistor resistance varies continuously (analogue) and is rough in character.
* Photodiodes, unlike photoresistors, are temperature sensitive and unidirectional.
* Phototransistors are not able to withstand voltages more than 1000 volts.
* Surges, spikes, and EM energy can damage phototransistors.

# Cost and Availability :
* Due to its basic architecture, the ldr sensor is inexpensive and widely available in the market, both offline and online. It's possible that the version available differs from mine (attached above). 
* The following are some of the online stores where I propose you shop:
